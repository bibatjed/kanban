### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page ✔️
- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks ✔️
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks ✔️
- Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns ✔️
- Hide/show the board sidebar ✔️
- Toggle the theme between light/dark modes ✔️
- **Bonus**: Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column ✔️
